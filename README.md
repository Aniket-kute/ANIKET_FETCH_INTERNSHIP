# ANIKET_FETCH_INTERNSHIP
Following were the steps that I used to complete the assessment 
1. First I analyzed the users.json data in jupyter to find for missing values and duplicate values. I cleaned the data in this STEP_3_Data_Quality_Issues.ipynb file
2. I visualized the tree structure of all the JSON files using JSON FORMATTER (https://jsonformatter.org/) to get an idea about how the tree structure of the file looks like. This helped me to identify nested JSON file present in the receipts.json file. To simplify the realtional structure I decided to separate the rewardsreceiptitemstatus list
3. To create a structured relational diagram I listed down all the tables and I found that since the receipts.json had a lot of attributes I decided to make a new table rewardsreceiptsitemlist.json .Thereon, I made a relational structure using these 4 tables in MySQl Workbench
4. To parse the receipts.json file into two separate tables I parsed the json file using SQL server. The code for this parasing is stored in rewardreceipt_query.sql .The table generated will be exported as a csv file from SQL server and then imported as a csv file in MySql. After creating the relational schema and populating all the tables, we run the queries from step 2
